The dotnet-library tree has been synchronized with
revision 12880 of src/library on $Date$.

Never, never, never, ever add/remove/edit files in the dotnet-library
tree by hand. If you need to change sth use the opportunity to merge
the changes that have occured since the last merge. Any manual intervention
makes the merging harder and is to be considerd rude and 

koko:~/scala/src/dotnet-library>svn merge \

You'll get many "Skipped missing target: ..." messages because this tree
only contains files that are different for MSIL. Hopefully, changes in those
files do not introduce anything platform-specific because they will be copied
from the src/library tree. If there are platform-specific changes, the
offending file has to be added to the dotnet-library tree and modified to
compile for .NET.
