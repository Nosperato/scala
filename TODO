Ideas and things to be done, in random order
============================================

* Private members that are specialized should be name-mangled. The are
  now turned to 'protected'. Probably 'expandName' is enough (keep the old
  symbols).

* specialize methods only when representation changes (basically when
  value parameters have naked type parameters or arrays of naked type
  params).

* handle specialized type members (whatever that may mean)

* Could we have better runtime types for specialized instances?

* Could we have user provided specializations?
