    Windows Registry API Native Interface

*Release 3.1.3, September 11, 2003*

The com.ice.jni.registry package is a Java native interface for the
Windows Registry API. This allows Java program to access, modify, and
export Windows Registry resources.

The com.ice.jni.registry package has been placed into the public domain.
Thus, you have absolutely no licensing issues to consider. You may do
anything you wish with the code. Of course, I always appreciate it when
you properly credit my work.

The package will work only with Java 1.1 and greater, and uses the
Javasoft native interface, not the Netscape interface. The package also
includes a DLL that implements the interface. The package has been used
with JDK1.2, and JDK1.3, JDK1.4, as well as JDK1.1.8.

The package includes the pre-built DLL (debug and release), source code
(both the Java and the DLL's C code), as well as the compiled Java classes.

The original release was posted on November 17, 1997. The current
release is 3.1.3, which was posted on September 11, 2003.
