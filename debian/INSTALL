How to Install Sun Java as a Debian package
===========================================

In short:

  (root)     > apt-get install java-package
  (non-root) > fakeroot make-jpkg <java-binary-package-name>.bin
  (root)     > dpkg -i <created-package-name>.deb


Step 1 - Get the Sun JVM
------------------------
Get the latest Sun JVM from here http://java.sun.com/, i.e.

  jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin   (48974825 bytes)


Step 2 - Install the Required Builder Package
---------------------------------------------
Installing Java on Debian is not the simplest thing in the world but
fortunatly the package 'java-package' will do most of the work for you
(assuming it works):

  > apt-get -u install java-package

Make sure that your repository is fully upto date before installing
this package or you might run into problems installing the latest JVM.
You also need fakeroot if you don't have it.


Step 3 - Create the .deb Package File
-------------------------------------
You have to perform this step as a non-root user so I suggest using
your own account. Create a temporary directory and copy the java .bin
installer file into it. Then run the command:

  > fakeroot make-jpkg jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin

changing the name of the Java .bin package if you need to.


Step 4 - Install the Java .deb Package
--------------------------------------
You need to be root to perform this step so switch now. Then execute
the following command:

  > dpkg -i sun-j2sdk1.5_1.5.0+update06_i386.deb

Of course you need to specify the correct package name if yours doesn't
match the name specified in the above command.


Step 5 - Check it Works
-----------------------
This should be the simplest step. Just execute the command:

  > java -version

as both root and another user to make sure everything is installed correctly.

  java version "1.5.0_06"
  Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
  Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)


Other Tasks
-----------
1) Removing the Java Packages

   Should you ever want to remove any of the Java packages you have
   installed you can do that with a command like this:

     > apt-get remove sun-j2sdk1.5

   which would remove the package installed above. If you can't remeber
   what packages you have installed try searching the apt-cache for the
   word sun e.g.

     > apt-cache search sun

   that should turn up the package but will match quite a lot of others
   as well.
