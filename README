Scala Software Distributions
----------------------------

- scala-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.tar.gz            Unix distribution
- scala-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.zip               Windows distribution

The standard distributions require Java 1.4.x or above. If you don't
know which version of Java you have, run the command "java -version".


Scala Tools
-----------

- scalac      Scala compiler
- scaladoc    Scala API documentation generator
- scalaint    Scala interactive interpreter
- scalarun    Scala interpreter

Run the command "scalac -help" to display the list of available
compiler options.

NB. socos, siris and surus are deprecated commands starting from
version 20030811-115735 of the Scala distribution, please use
respectively scalac, scalaint and scalarun instead.


Install on Unix
---------------

Untar the archive. All scala tools are located in the directory "bin".

You may test the distribution by running the script "scala-test"
located in the subdirectory "share/scala/test/bin".


Install on Windows
------------------

Unzip the archive. All scala tools are located in the "bin"
directory. Before running any of these tools, you must define the
environment variable SCALA_HOME to point to the home directory of the
scala distribution.

On Windows 95/98/Me, this can be done by adding the following command
to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then rebooting your machine.

set SCALA_HOME=<install-directory>\scala-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss

On Windows NT/2000/XP, open the "Control Panel", open the "System"
applet, select the "Advanced" tab, click on "Environment Variables",
click on "New..." in the user variable section and enter the following
informations:

Variable Name : SCALA_HOME
Variable Value: <install-directory>\scala-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss

If you have Administrator privileges, you may install the tools for
all users of your machine by creating a new system variable instead of
a new user variable.
